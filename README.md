* A piscine is a 2-week intensive learning in a specific topic. There are new assignments every weekday and on the weekends there are group projects. 
	* day00 - basics
	* day01 - basics
	* day02 - basics, operator overload

* We can only use CPP98 on this piscine.
* I put the subjects of each day in their directory.
* I passed all the days and rushes with the grade of 119/100 (the extra 19 points is the bonus).

### How to run the codes
* Most of the code can be compiled with this command.
	```clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror *.cpp```
* I also have Makefile in some assignment.
* More information for the rush projects in their directory readme.
